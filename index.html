    <h1>Privacy Policy - Dipisha's Art Corner Analytics</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 14 December 2025</p>

    <p>
      Creator Analytics (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is a personal analytics dashboard
      operated by <strong>DIPISHA SHIVANGI / Dipisha's Art Corner</strong>. This
      page explains how we handle information when you connect social media
      accounts such as YouTube, Pinterest, and Instagram to the dashboard.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Access</h2>
    <p>
      When you connect a platform, we access only the data provided through that
      platform’s official APIs, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Channel, account, or profile identifiers</li>
      <li>
        Analytics data like views, impressions, reach, clicks, and subscriber
        counts
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> collect your passwords, and we do not post
      content on your behalf.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>
      The data we access is used solely to display analytics inside the Creator
      Analytics dashboard for your own use. We do not sell your data or share it
      with unrelated third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Some analytics data may be stored in our database to show trends over
      time. You can disconnect a platform at any time, which stops new data from
      being fetched. You may also request deletion of stored data by contacting
      us.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Our app relies on third-party services such as Google (YouTube),
      Pinterest, and Meta (Instagram). Your use of those services is also
      governed by their respective terms and privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to request data
      deletion, please contact us at:
